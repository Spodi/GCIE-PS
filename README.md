# GameCube Image Extractor Script for PowerShell
 
Extracts or lists files from an uncompressed GameCube image (uncompressed iso). As this was originally written for Harbor Master 64's Port of OoT "Ship of Harkinian", it tries to extract a PAL OoT or MQ ROM by default. But it can also be used to extract any raw file from the iso by name or just list its file system.

There is also a C# port of this ported by xoascf (aka Amaro): https://github.com/xoascf/GCIE
